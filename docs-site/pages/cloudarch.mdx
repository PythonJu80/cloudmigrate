## Creating Diagrams

### Drag and Drop

1. Expand a category in the left sidebar
2. Drag a service onto the canvas
3. Click the service to configure properties
4. Connect services by dragging between connection points

### AI-Assisted Design

The Architecture Agent helps design infrastructure through conversation:

1. Open the chat panel
2. Describe your requirements
3. The agent asks clarifying questions about scale, security, budget
4. Click "Generate Architecture" when ready
5. The AI creates the diagram with proper connections

The agent understands AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars:
- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization

## Templates

Pre-built architecture templates:

- Three-Tier Web Application
- Serverless API
- Data Pipeline
- Machine Learning Platform

## Deployment

CloudArch generates CloudFormation templates from your diagrams.

### Generate Template

1. Click "Export" in the toolbar
2. Select "CloudFormation"
3. Review the generated YAML template
4. Download or copy to clipboard

### Deploy to AWS

1. Click "Deploy" in the toolbar
2. Enter a stack name
3. Review the resources to be created
4. Confirm deployment
5. Monitor stack creation progress

The deployment uses AWS CloudFormation APIs:
- CreateStack for new deployments
- UpdateStack for modifications
- DeleteStack for teardown

### Supported Resources

CloudFormation generation supports:

| Service | Resource Type |
|---------|---------------|
| VPC | AWS::EC2::VPC with subnets, route tables, gateways |
| EC2 | AWS::EC2::Instance with security groups |
| RDS | AWS::RDS::DBInstance |
| S3 | AWS::S3::Bucket |
| Lambda | AWS::Lambda::Function |
| DynamoDB | AWS::DynamoDB::Table |
| ELB | AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer |
| API Gateway | AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi |
