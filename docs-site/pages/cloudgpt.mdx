# CloudGPT

CloudGPT is an AI assistant for querying your transfer data, S3 buckets, and generating visualizations.

## Capabilities

### Database Queries

Query your transfer history with filters:
- Status (COMPLETED, FAILED, PENDING, UPLOADING, CANCELLED)
- File size range (minSize, maxSize in bytes)
- File name (partial match)
- Date range (dateFrom, dateTo)

### S3 Operations

Interact with your S3 buckets:
- List objects in a bucket
- Browse folders/prefixes
- Get file metadata

### Visualizations

Generate charts from your data:

| Chart Type | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| pie/donut | Status breakdowns (completed vs failed) |
| bar | Compare categories (transfers per bucket) |
| line | Trends over time (transfers per day) |
| area | Volume over time (storage used per day) |
| scatter | Correlations (file size vs upload time) |

### Tables

Generate data tables with columns and rows from query results.

### Metrics

Display single-value metrics with optional trend indicators.

## Example Queries

```
Show me a chart of transfers by status
```

```
Create a table of my recent uploads
```

```
What's in my S3 bucket?
```

```
Show me all failed transfers
```

```
How many files did I upload this week?
```

## RAG Context

CloudGPT uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to include relevant context:

1. Your query is embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
2. Similar chunks are retrieved from the knowledge base
3. Context is included in the prompt to the LLM

### Knowledge Sources

- Global CloudMigrate knowledge base
- Company-specific knowledge (if configured in Settings)

## Company Knowledge

In Settings, you can add company context:
1. Enter your company website URL
2. Click "Scrape and Learn"
3. The content is chunked, embedded, and stored
4. CloudGPT includes this context in responses

## Threads

Conversations are saved as threads:
- Create new threads
- Load previous threads
- Delete individual or all threads

## Response Format

CloudGPT responds with structured JSON that the UI renders:
- `type: "query"` - Database query with filters
- `type: "s3_list"` - S3 listing operation
- `type: "chart"` - Visualization with chart config
- `type: "table"` - Data table
- `type: "insight"` - Text-only response
